| API family name | Dynamic People Density Information | 
| API family owner | Telefonica |
| API summary | The service enables developers with the capability to get dynamic population density data in a specific area for a future date&time, considering anonymized information of the network connected devices in the requested area at the flight time.<br /> Use Case (1): Providing BVLOS flight the data to meet SORA 2.5 requirements in terms of intrinsic Ground Risk Class (iGRC).<br /> Use Case (2): Providing data to identify if the ground risk class for a given drone flight is acceptable for the time of the flight, or an alternative time should be considered to lower the risk.<br /> Service Inputs: Area of the flight (delimited space) and adjacent area. Date & time range.<br /> Service Outputs: maximum population density value for the given area and adjacent area, and interval corresponding to the valid range of that value. (space and time maps) |
| Technical viability | The viability has been checked and it is based on providing the amount of people on a flight path obtained by aggregating number of SIMs connected to each antenna on the path and without considering M2M SIMs, extrapolating to real-desnsity of population based on tht level of radio occupancy. No individual subscriber data will be delivered as the information will be anonymized. <br>The output calculation will be defined as part of the API specification, in order to align on a common algorithm among telcos. The calculation will include<br>1. Aggregate number of devices/SIM cards connected to the mobile network, discriminating those that are classified as IoT/M2M. This relates with other APIs proposed.<br>2. Data prediction algorithm. Since the data is requested in a future moment, a prediction is requried to calculate the expected values, taht needs to be defined and agreed. For instance, a Basic implementation:  Average population in the past X weeks on same day-time, e.g. for a Tuesday 11:45, the number of people "attributed" to the area on the N preceding Tuesdays at the same time/hour. <br>3. Extrapolation of the people amount from the number of detected connected devices, also to be defined and agreed. MNO market share is a key parameter to design the extrapolation method.|
| Commercial viability | For use in drone flight scenarios, where  population density is required to ensure a secure level of risk. |
