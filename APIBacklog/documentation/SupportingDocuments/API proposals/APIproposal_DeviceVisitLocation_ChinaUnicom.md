| API summary | **Description**     <br>  This API allows for the API Consumer to Query the latest visit locations of device within 7 days.    <br>  **Use Cases**     <br>  User Story1: Anomaly Detection   <br>  Role: anti-fraud system    <br>  Goal:As an anti-fraud system, I want to utilize the API to detect anomalies in a user's visited provinces over the last seven days.If a user's visited provinces significantly deviate from their usual pattern or if there are sudden long-distance movements, trigger an alert for further identity verification or security measures.   <br> User Story2: Device Location Consistency Check    <br>  Role: anti-fraud system    <br>  Goal:As an anti-fraud system, I aim to use the API to cross-verify the user's device location with the visited provinces in the last seven days. If there is a notable inconsistency between the user's device location and visited provinces, it may indicate potential fraud. The system should take appropriate actions, such as requesting additional identity verification steps.   <br>  **Input/Output**     <br>  **Input**     <br>  **MSISDN**    <br>  **Output**   <br>  **List\<geoCode\> geoCodeList**     :Due to the different regional coding methods in different countries and regions, it is difficult to accurately describe provincial information. We believe that Telefonica's proposed parameter composition method in Device Location Verification - Postal/Administrative Code is feasible.  <br> Specify the area to be verified in a generic way: <br> Use a “geoCode” object having three attributes: <br> “countryCode”: code for the country where the location must be verified. This is necessary because the values of zip codes or administrative codes make sense only for the country where they belong to. <br>“codeType”: the type of code to be used. E.g., “zip”, “adminLevel3”, etc. <br>“codeValue”: value of the code itself. E.g., “75016”, “492755”.  <br>|
| Technical viability | This API is based on real-time location information expansion, recording changes in base stations, and querying user visits based on base station location.The database needs to store the XDR signaling information of the user for the past 7 days |
| Commercial viability | For use in anti fraud and precision marketing scenarios|
