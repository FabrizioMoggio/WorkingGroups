  version: 0.0.1
  description: |
    Service enabling API for customer premises equipment (CPE) management. The APIs initial focus is on managing **Isolated Networks** (API clients can manage the access details for logically separated networks on the same device) and device reboot requests.

    # Introduction
    An isolated network is a network access configuration where each configuration is for a logically separated Local Area Network (LAN). Application developers can create, modify, or remove these networks which could be useful in scenarios such as:

    - A property owner wants to create a temporary network for the duration of a short-term booking or long-term rental.
    - A property manager wants to replicate the network access details across multiple devices at one or more locations such as common areas, offices, etc.
    - A security/privacy-minded user wants to create one or more networks for their guests or Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network clients.

    A reboot request is simply a request to reboot a network operator supplied network access device. Application developers can create these requests which could be useful in scenarios such as:

    - A property owner wants to recover from a faulty network state by rebooting gateway device.
    - A property manager wants to reboot multiple devices at one or more locations such as common areas, offices, etc.

    # Relevant Terms and Definitions
    - **Isolated Network**: Network access configuration where each configuration is for a logically separated Local Area Network (LAN) when on the same device. Isolation in this context means that traffic will not be forwarded or routed from one logical LAN to another on the same device. The isolation implementation must be considered a logical construct only. Network operators are free to choose how to implement this behavior using any number of technologies such as with VLANs or OpenFlow rules. Traffic between two network clients using the same isolated network access details, but across different devices, is currently undefined behavior.
    - **Reboot Request**: A request to reboot a network operator supplied network access device.
    - **Device**: A network operator supplied network access device that supports isolated networks.  Multiple devices that support LAN connectivity across the same isolated network (e.g., mesh Wi-Fi, Thread personal area network, etc.) SHOULD be presented as a single device for implementations of this API.
    - **Network Operator**: Service provider that implements this API and has operational control of supporting devices.
    - **Service Owner**: Customer of a network operator and resource owner with one or more devices that supports this API across one or more service sites.
    - **Service Site**: A distinct service owner location, as interpreted by the network operator, with one or more devices.  A service site typically has a one-to-one relationship with the mailing address of the location.  Network operators that support a single identity or interchangeable identities for multiple service sites at the same mailing address (e.g., a residential and business account, an office and common area account, etc.) MUST provide some distinction in the property address (e.g., attn: Home Office, attn: Common Area, etc.).  Multiple service sites, for the same mailing address, but for unrelated service owner identities, do not have this requirement.
    - **End-User**: The user connecting to an isolated network with a network client.
    - **Network Client**: End-user equipment connecting to an isolated network (e.g., laptop, phone, IoT device, etc.).
    - **API Client**: A first- or third-party software system managing isolated networks through this API.

    # API Functionality
    This API allows API clients to manage isolated networks. It has two operational modes: simple and advanced. OAuth 2.0 is used for authorizing an identity (resource holder) and scopes are used for role-based authorization.

    ## Authorization
    Authorization of API clients is typically performed by the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type such that service owners delegate access to their resources exposed by this API to the API client.  PKCE MUST be used when the API client secret cannot be secured (e.g., mobile application or single page application without a secure back-end).  This API can also be used with the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant type, though such a use case only makes sense for first-party network operator API clients or when the service owner operates their own API client (client ID is bound to the service owner's identity).

    ### Scopes
    OAuth 2.0 scopes are used to protect the service owner's information and privacy.  The general format is `<API_name>-<Resource>-<Permission>`.  A resource may be further broken down into `<Resource_name>-<Field>` or `<Resource_name>-<Role>` for granular permissions. Scopes also control output information as opposed to just authorizing endpoints. Each endpoint definition will clearly state what scopes are needed to access an endpoint and which are needed to access additional information within an endpoint. Below are some general rules for scopes in this API.

    - Government regulated information has special scopes, such as physical locations or hardware addresses of network devices.  Network operators are expected to follow any local laws when sharing this information with an API client.
    - Scopes have inheritance when one scope would otherwise require the inherited scope.
    - Read scopes for one resource impacts the output of another resource when the requested resource has a relationship with the first (e.g., listing networks on a device requires both device and network read scopes).
    - Isolated networks are broken down into 3 roles allowing service owners to grant granular permissions to API clients: default, primary, and auxiliary. The default role allows API clients to manage networks it creates. These are considered a type of auxiliary or secondary network. The primary role allows API clients to manage the main network access configuration. The last role allows API clients to manage all auxiliary networks (owned and those created by other first- or third-party API clients). Complete administrative control requires both the primary and auxiliary roles.

    | Scope | Description | Inherits
    |-------|-------------|---------
    | **cpe-management-service-sites-read** | List a service owner's service sites
    | **cpe-management-service-sites-location-read** | Read a service site's physical location | cpe-management-service-sites-read
    | **cpe-management-devices-read** | List a service owner's devices
    | **cpe-management-devices-hardware-address-read** | Read a service owner's device's hardware address | cpe-management-devices-read
    | **cpe-management-devices-write** | Modify which networks are configured on a service owner's devices | cpe-management-devices-read
    | **cpe-management-isolated-networks-read** | List a service owner's isolated networks created by the calling API client
    | **cpe-management-isolated-networks-write** | Create or modify a service owner's isolated networks created by the calling API client | cpe-management-isolated-networks-read
    | **cpe-management-isolated-networks-primary-read** | Access information about a service owner's primary isolated network

    | **cpe-management-isolated-networks-auxiliary-read** | List service owner's auxiliary isolated networks | cpe-management-isolated-networks-read
    | **cpe-management-isolated-networks-auxiliary-write** | Create or modify a service owner's auxiliary isolated networks | cpe-management-isolated-networks-auxiliary-read<br />cpe-management-isolated-networks-write
    | **cpe-management-reboot-requests-read** | List a service owner's reboot requests created by the calling API client
    | **cpe-management-reboot-requests-write** | Create or modify a service owner's reboot request created by the calling API client | cpe-management-reboot-request-read

    ### Claims
    OAuth 2.0 claims are not used by this API to allow for the use of JSON Web Encryption (JWE) access tokens.

    ## General Usage
    This API is intended for creating, modifying, or deleting isolated networks using the `/isolated-networks` endpoints to build access detail configurations. The `/service-sites` endpoints are used for iterating over a service owner's locations. The exact location may be requested with an additional scope to assist with reconciling information about service sites when the API client operator has an existing relationship with the service owner. Similarly, the `/devices` endpoints are used for iterating over and configuring a service owner's devices.  The hardware address may be requested for the same purpose of reconciling information from another source (e.g., database, persons with physical device access, etc.).

    ### Operational Modes
    Two operational modes are supported: simple and advanced.  The default operational mode is advanced.  Simple mode is enabled on a per OAuth 2.0 access token basis when the following criteria are met:

    1. The OAuth 2.0 access token MUST only be authorized with `cpe-management-isolated-networks-*` scopes.
    2. The OAuth 2.0 access token MUST be for service owners with one and only one device and one and only one service site.

    Simple mode implicitly inherits read/write access from the `cpe-management-isolated-networks-*` scopes to the one and only one device at one and only one service site without exposing endpoints or information for those resources to the API client (Principal of Least Privilege).  If criteria 1 is met but not criteria 2, `/isolated-networks` and `/isolated-networks/{netId}` endpoints MUST fail with a `403 OPERATIONAL_MODE_NOT_SUPPORTED`.  Simple mode is not intended to be used for service owners that do not meet criteria 2.  Those service owners must grant explicit authorization to service site and device resources.

      All `/isolated-networks` and `/isolated-networks/{netId}` endpoints are indirectly impacted by the operational mode (e.g., reading what devices are configured with an isolated network, writing changes to an isolated network to device configurations, etc.).  That is, they all require implicit (simple) or explicit (advanced) device authorization.

    The following endpoint(s) are directly impacted by the operational mode:

    | Method | Endpoint | Mode | Impact |
    |--------|----------|------|--------|
    | `POST` | `/isolated-networks` | Simple | `devices` field in the request body MUST NOT be set or it MUST be set to `undefined`.  Network is configured to the one and only one device.
    | `POST` | `/isolated-networks` | Advanced | `devices` field in the request body MUST be set to an `empty list` or `list of device IDs`.  Network is staged or configured to the specified devices.

    ## Comments for Network Operators
    The following comments are for Network Operators implementing this API.

    ### Mesh Systems
    Mesh systems SHOULD be represented as a single device when implementing this API due to the undefined behavior of LAN connectivity across multiple devices with the same isolated network.  The recommendation is to use the gateway hardware address of the mesh system when exposing that field, though the hardware address of any node in the mesh may be used.  If an end-user replaces the equipment, all existing isolated networks SHOULD be synced to the new device representing this mesh.  Alternatively, a synthetic hardware address may also be used if the specification for the address type allows.

        ## Simple Mode
        Simple mode creates the network and configures it to the service owner's one and only one device at their one and only one service location.  The `devices` field MUST NOT be set or it MUST be set to `undefined`.

        **Required Scopes:**

            - `cpe-management-isolated-networks-auxiliary-write`

        ## Advanced Mode
        Advanced mode creates the network and optionally configures it to one or more devices.  The `devices` field MUST be set to an `empty list` or `list of device IDs`.  Networks will be staged when setting `devices` to an `empty list`.
