| ---- | ----- |
| API family name | Network Slicing API | 
| API family owner | China Unicom, China Telecom, Huawei |
| API family supporter | China Mobile, China Unicom, China Telecom, Huawei, TBD |
| API summary | There are emerging requirements in high-rate time-critical applications in the areas of Cloud-gaming, AR/VR, Live Video Streaming, Real-time Multi-Media etc through mobile networks. The on-demand network slicing service technology can provide a network slice reservation method for such scenarios to meet the SLA assurance expected by developers for a specific time period and a dedicated service area. The Network Slicing API provides such abilities for developers to reserve, dynamically provisioning, query, dynamically destroy a slice with customized SLA assurance capabilities, customized service duration, expected slice covered locations and so on. |
| Technical viability | This API requires the availability of RAN slicing, UDM, PCF, and network slicing management services as expressed in 3GPP TS 28.531 (network slice provisioning operations), TS 28.541 (Information model definitions for network slice NRM) standards.|
| Commercial viability | Network Slicing has been commercialized in many fields. Itâ€™s especially valuable in influencer live video stream, new media, power fiber scenario, there already appear many commercial use cases.|
