## API proposals taken for TSC approval 

The TSC was held on 7th September, 10-11h CEST. One of the agenda points was to decide on the API proposals input by Backlog WG. The outcomes of this decision are as follows: 

**Click To Dial** 
- Decision: Go! (no objection)
	- The API proposal is approved. 
- Discussion: 
	- Henry Calvert (GSMA) commented that GSMA will try to get more supporters for this API (and get in touch with China Mobile). 
	- Jan Friman (Ericsson) indicated that Ericsson will probably ask to be part of the maintainers (AP 20230907-05)
- Next steps:
	- Supporting companies to propose their initial maintainers for the subproject (AP 20230907-06).
	- TSC will collect this information, and decide to propose optional additional initial maintainers. The TSC will officially nominate the (list of) initial maintainers by next TSC meeting. 
	- CAMARA admins will create the subproject repository. 

**KYC Match and KYC Fill-in**
- Decision: Go! (no objection)
	- Both API proposals are approved.
- Discussion: 
	-  TSC proposal is to have separate APIs but tackled in the same subproject. Toshi (KDDI) as API proposal owner agreed with this decision.
- Next steps:
	- Supporting companies or API backlog team to provide a name for this WG (AP 20230907-07). A proposal from Herbert (DT, TSC chair) is "Customer Data Information". 
	- Supporting companies to propose their initial maintainers for the subproject (AP 20230907-08).
	- TSC will collect this information, and decide to propose optional additional initial maintainers. The TSC will officially nominate the (list of) initial maintainers by next TSC meeting. 
	- CAMARA admins will create the subproject repository. 


**Site-to-Cloud (S2C) VPN** 
- Decision: No-Go! (clarification requested)
	- The API proposal is not approved, for now. 
- Discussion: 
	- During the TSC meeting, George Class (TM Forum) noted a possible colission of this API with work done in TM Forum. He mentioned that AT&T will showcase on DTW23 in Copenhaguen a catalyst on the same topics. After some discussion, TSC asked to China Telecom (API owner) to clarify the API scope with current work done by AT&T and check whether AT&T could be a supporter of the API. Ludovic (Orange) kindly volunteer to help put China Telecom in contact with TM Forum and AT&T delegates. 
	- During API backlog meeting, Dan Xu (China Telecom) asked for next steps with regards for re-submission: whether the API needs to be assessed again in backlog WG, or it can be directly re-submitted to TSC.
	- Jose (Telefónica) clarified that upon addressing the clarification requested by TSC, then China Telecom can re-submit the proposal to TSC, but needs to inform of this to API backlog chair at least one week in advance (see below AoB for further details).
- Next steps:
	- China Telecom to clarify the API scope with current work done by AT&T and check whether AT&T could be a supporter of the API (AP 20230907-09). 


**WebRTC**. 
- Decision: Go! (no objection)
	- The API proposal is approved.
- Discussion: 
	-  TSC requests the future sub-project to check possible colission with WebRTC standards.
- Next steps:
	- Supporting companies to propose their initial maintainers for the subproject (AP 20230907-10)
	- TSC will collect this information, and decide to propose optional additional initial maintainers. The TSC will officially nominate the (list of) initial maintainers by next TSC meeting. 
	- CAMARA admins will create the subproject repository.


## AoB
**Relationship of CAMARA with GSMA Open Gateway**
* Dan Xu (China Telecom): How GSMA Open Gateway project and CAMARA are related, and how could it be possible to speed up alingment between both groups in terms of scope and API proposals?
* Jorge (Telefónica) explained that ways-of-working (WoW) is as follows: i) Open Gateway proposes new API/services based on the prioritization criteria defined and managed by the Product Workstream; ii) the proposed API/services are allocated to API backlog; iii) CAMARA takes these API proposals as any other API proposal. Jorge also noted that the CAMARA TSC and GSMA Open Gateway are now working on a new WoW (see [#82](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/issues/82)), with the aim to align releases cycles. Optimization point may come from GSMA ensuring that the requests (API templates) are totally pre-aligned with the expectations from CAMARA, to speed up TSC approval.

**Next TSC meeting to be held on 21st September**
- API owners of not-yet-approved APIs are encouraged to declare whether they want to take their individual API proposals for decision <em>before 14th Sept</em> (AP 20230907-01, 20230907-02, 20230907-04).
- Supporting companies of approved APIs need to propose their initial maintainers for the sub-projects (AP 20230907-06, 20230907-08, 20230907-09).
- Companies that verbally declared their willingness to become supporters of some APIs need to submit PR to the backlog table (AP 20230907-03, 20230907-05). See further details on the Q&A clause.

# Q&A
**How to add new supporters?**

If a company wants to become supporter of an API which is included in the backlog, then a delegate of this company needs to add the company's name in the 'supporters' column in the [API backlog](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/APIBacklog.md). 

**How to take an API submission for TSC approval?** 

The proccess is detailed [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/blob/main/documentation/API-onboarding.md).

1. The WG chair checks that the template is duly filled in. Otherwise, the API owner is requested to provide missing information.
2. After this sanity check, each WG participant declares their support (which is also documented in the template). The more support an API proposal gets, the better (it may get more traction).
3. When the API owner considers the API proposal is in good shape to go for approval, it informs the WG chair accordingly.
4. Upon receiving this information, the WG chair merges the Pull Request into the main branch, and sends the API proposal to the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) of CAMARA. This action shall be completed at least one week prior to the TSC meeting where the API proposal will be voted upon.
 
The whole procedure (steps 1-4) should be done within 2 regular meetings of the API Backlog WG. Nonetheless, it is up to the API owner to decide if it wants to shorten or extend this time period.

**Once an API proposal is formally approved, what are the next steps?** 

Upon approval by the TSC, the following actions need to be taken:
- [API backlog action] Supporting companies to propose their initial maintainers for the subproject.
- [TSC action] upon receiving maintainers from API backlog WG, to decide to propose optional additional initial maintainers. The TSC will officially nominate the (list of) initial maintainers by next TSC meeting. 
- [CAMARA admins] to create the subproject repository. 

NOTE: After the initial maintainers are nominated, the criteria for further maintainers would be three months of active contribution to the sub project. Code owners are to be decided by the maintainers within the subproject.
