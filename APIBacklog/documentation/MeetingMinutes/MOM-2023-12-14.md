## New Procedures in API backlog meetings

A number of improvements are under discussion with leadership team of OGW project (Henry), CAMARA Project (Markus), Product Definition WS (Helene) and TSC (Herbert). As of today, the WG adopted agreements are three:
1. To close the agenda SEVEN DAYS BEFORE the conf. call. 
	- In case a WG participant wants to include a point in the agenda (e.g., present a new API proposal), this participant shall ensure the corresponding issue is opened in Github by then. 
	- Exceptional situations will be treated separately.
2. New schedule of conf. calls:
	- 2nd Thursday of the month (10-11 CET)
	- 4th Thursday of the month (15-16 CET)
3. Send agenda to TSC mail list, to encourage more TSC member companies to join the call and provide comments when they identify APIs which are of interest for them.
4. Minutes will be uploaded to [Confluence space](https://wiki.camaraproject.org/display/CAM/API+Backlog+Working+Group) in the near future. Message and pointer will be provided in due time.

## Discussion

| **Agenda  Item**  |  Owner| Description |
| ----------- | --- | ----------- |
| **Current issues** |  |  |
| [#317](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/317) | China Unicom | **New Proposal-Network Slicing API** <br> The API template is available in [PR#333](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/333)<br> Updates: <br> - Huawei clarified that the original intention was to include this as part of OGW drop #3; however, it was not shortlisted and next round would come in three months, which is quite late, hence the proposal directly in CAMARA. <br> - Comments regarding naming and differences with ongoing APIs (e.g. QoD, SiteToCloudVPN) require. <br> - Continue discussion offline. |
| [#328](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/328) | China Unicom | **New API proposal: Region User Count** <br>The API template is available in [PR#327](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/327). <br> Input from OGW drop #3. <br> Updates: <br> -  The API proposal has been approved in the TSC meeting held in 7th Dec, with some activities for the APIBacklog WG to act upon. These activities are detailed in the issue thread. <br> - The issue is not eligible to be closed yet.  | 
| [#330](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/330) | China Unicom| **New API proposal: Device Visit Location**<br>The API template is available in [PR#329](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/329). <br> Input from OGW drop #3. <br> Updates: <br> - The API proposal has NOT been approved in the TSC meeting held in 7th Dec. Feedback from TSC is that this API can only be implemented in certain countries, as some states (e.g. EU) prohibit storing of the required data. Legal situation needs to be clarified. Emails threads exchanged between TSC and GSMA leadership team to clarify way forward, with no conclusion for now. Generally, the view of GSMA is that some sort of "health warning" should be attached to avoid external viewers misinterpreting where and now this API would be used. <br> - Next steps detailed in the issue thread. <br> - The issue is not eligible to be closed yet. |

# Q&A

**How does CAMARA API pipeline work?**

The pipeline consists of FOUR stages:
<br> A. Submission of the API proposal.
<br> B. Evaluation of the API proposal.
<br> C. API proposal voting & decision.
<br> D. Sub-Project setup.

The following clauses provides details on individual stages. 

**Stage A: Submission of the API proposal**

<u>Participants</u>: API owner.<br>
<u>Description</u>: The proccess is detailed [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/blob/main/documentation/API-onboarding.md). To proceed with the submission, the API owner shall follow these steps:
1. Fill in the template available [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/Commonalities/documentation/API-proposal-template.md) and save it with the following name: "APIproposal\_\<APIname\>\_\<owner\>. md" locally.
2. Create a new issue in the API Backlog Working Group repository, labeled with "API Backlog".
3. Upload the filled-in template to [GitHub repository folder for API proposals](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/tree/main/APIBacklog/documentation/SupportingDocuments/API%20proposals) via Pull Request. This Pull Request shall be associated to the issue created in the previous step.

**Stage B: Evaluation of the API proposal** 

<u>Participants</u>: API owner, API backlog WG.<br>
<u>Description</u>: The proccess is detailed [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/blob/main/documentation/API-onboarding.md). Upon submission, the API owner will present the proposal in the next API backlog WG meeting, to socialize it with the rest of partners. In paralell..

1. The WG chair checks that the template is duly filled in. Otherwise, the API owner is requested to provide missing information.
2. After this sanity check, each WG participant declares their support. If a company wants to become supporter of an API, then a delegate of this company needs to add the company's name in the 'supporters' column in the [API backlog table](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/APIBacklog.md). The more support an API proposal gets, the better (it may get more traction).
3. When the API owner considers the API proposal is in good shape to go for approval, it informs the WG chair accordingly.
4. Upon receiving this information, the WG chair merges the Pull Request into the main branch, and sends the API proposal to the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) of CAMARA. This action shall be completed at least one week prior to the TSC meeting where the API proposal will be voted upon.
 
The whole procedure (steps 1-4) should be done within 2 regular meetings of the API Backlog WG. Nonetheless, it is up to the API owner to decide if it wants to shorten or extend this time period.

**Stage C: API proposal & voting decision**

<u>Participants</u>: TSC.<br>
<u>Description</u>: The proccess is detailed [here](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/blob/main/documentation/API-onboarding.md). Upon receiving the API proposal and notification from the API backlog WG chair, the TSC studies the proosal and votes it at the next TSC meeting. 

NOTE 1: Possible decisions outcomes:
- Not Accepted: The API proposal is rejected, and thus will not be included in any API Sub-Project. The TSC will need to inform the API backlog WG of this decision, and clarify next steps: either (1) remove this API proposal from backlog, with objecting companies providing justifications why; or (2) ask for changes (e.g., clarifications, corrections, gaps to be addressed) required in order for the API to be re-submitted by the API supporters.
- Accepted: In this case, the TSC shall specify whether the API proposal is to be hosted by a new or existing Sub Project.

NOTE 2: The TSC may also propose changes to an API proposal and take the decision considering these changes. The TSC documents the decision in the [CAMARA API overview list](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/APIBacklog.md) (fills in columns TSC date and TSC decision / Sub Project; in case of a No-Go "Rejected" is documented there).

**Stage D: Sub-Project setup**

<u>Participants</u>: API backlog WG, TSC, CAMARA admin team<br>
<u>Description</u>: If an API proposal is accepted and there is a neeed to open a new Sub-Project, the following steps are needed:
1. Supporting companies propose their initial maintainers to be added for the Sub-Project. The API backlog WG chair centralizes this information, and sends it to the TSC.
2. The TSC will use this input to oficially nominate the initial maintainers by next TSC meeting.
3. The CAMARA admin team creates the Sub-Project repository. 

NOTE: After the initial maintainers are nominated, the criteria for further maintainers would be three months of active contribution to the sub project. Code owners are to be decided by the maintainers within the subproject.
